Docker Jupyter Container
========================


This [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) Docker container is used by the [Galaxy Project](https://galaxyproject.org/) and can be installed from the [docker.io index](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/bgruening/docker-jupyter-notebook/).

```bash
docker pull quay.io/galaxy/docker-jupyter-notebook
```

Usage
=====

* Build your own image and run it

 [Docker](https://www.docker.com) is a pre-requirement for this project. You can build the container with:
 ```bash
  docker build -t jupyter-notebook . 
 ```
 The build process can take some time, but if finished you can run your container with:
 ```bash
  docker run -p 7777:8888 -i -t jupyter-notebook
 ```
 and you will have a running [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org) instance on ``http://localhost:7777/ipython/``.

* Run a pre-build image from docker registry

 ``docker run -p 7777:8888 quay.io/galaxy/docker-jupyter-notebook:25.04 ``

Some environment variables are made available to the user which will allow for configuring the behaviour of individual instances.
